# guess-to-impress

## Description

 This is a multiple choice quiz made with JS, HTML, and CSS to test your knowledge on random unimportant information.

-This project was a way to create a multiple choice quiz mainly in JS with minimal html and CSS elements.
-The quiz was created as a way to hold a timer, multiple inputs and buttons, and a highscore page with some locally stored data.
-I learned quite a bit about using localstorage with this project. The code itself could use some cleaning up and simplifying, but learning to have all three code files to work together correctly (mostly) was a good start.
    --If I were to start this project again, I would focus on cleanliness and readability.

If you run out of time, the top right corner of the screen displays "OUT OF TIME SUCKER" and the quiz ends displaying your final score.
You will see a place to enter your initials to be added to the highscores.

After submitting your initials, you will be brought to the page displaying previously recorded highscores (if any).
There will be a button to go back (restart quiz) and a button to clear highscores.

If you clear highscores, the message "Highscores Deleted" will display.

## Credits

Previous lesson activities.
Different assistance from classmates - mostly Ben Sboto and Dave - helped me review my code.
George Yoo (TA) spent a while helping me work out some issues I created for myself and helped guide me the right direction for finishing my project up. 
Thank you all!
